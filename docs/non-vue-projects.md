# Non-Vue Projects

`vbuild` can be gracefully used to prototype a non-Vue project.

## React Projects

If you're using React JSX syntax, you would like to update babel plugins for this, see [babel options](/config.html#babel-options).

In this case, you may set the vendor option to `['react', 'react-dom']` and more.

If you want to enable hot reloading for React components, check out the [merge webpack config](/config.html#merge-webpack-config) part.
