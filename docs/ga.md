# Google Analytics

You can set `ga` option to your Google Analytics track ID to enable this feature:

```js
// vue.config.js
export default {
  ga: 'UA-5384829-10'
}
```

Since you're most likely building a Single Page App, check out  [Single Page Application Tracking](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/single-page-applications) for using Google Analytics with SPA.
