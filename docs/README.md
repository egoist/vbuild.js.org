# vbuild

vbuild just allows you to bundle vue.js projects without installing the same dependencies over and over again. And you don't need to configure the same stuffs again either.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g vbuild
# if you prefer yarn
# yarn global add vbuild
```

Alternatively, you can install `vbuild` as a devDependency in your project.
